## 🎮 High-Performance Swarm Simulation & Engine System
**C++ • Custom Engine Framework**

[![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-Demo-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R8rz6CtQNw) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repo-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/acosta3/BUG-SWARM)

**🔹 Architected a real-time simulation** supporting up to **200,000 AI entities** with deterministic, frame-rate independent updates

**🔹 Refactored entity data from AoS to SoA** for cache-efficient hot-loop iteration using contiguous, index-based storage

**🔹 Scaled proximity logic** with a uniform spatial grid and distance-based AI LOD scheduling to maintain stable frame times

## 🧗 Unreal Engine 5 C++ Climbing System Plugin
**C++ • Unreal Engine 5.6**

[![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-Demo-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube)](#)

**🔹 Built a traversal system** (ledge grab, climb up/down, vault) and shipped it as a **reusable UE5 plugin**

**🔹 Implemented surface detection** using capsule sweeps and line traces with normals and walkable-angle checks

**🔹 Integrated AnimBP and Motion Warping**; handled uneven ledges, false positives, and UE 5.6 module edge cases

## ⚽ Unreal Engine Split Screen Soccer Game
**Blueprints • Unreal Engine 5.6**

[![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-Demo-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube)](#)

**🔹 Implemented a physics-driven football system** with dynamic ball ownership, enabling controlled dribbling, loose-ball states, and steals

**🔹 Designed a hybrid ball-control model** (assist forces + physics) for responsive dribbling, realistic collisions, and player-driven interactions

**🔹 Built local split-screen support** with independent player input, shared ball state, and synchronized scoring/goal reactions

---

## 🏀 Basketball Jump Shot Analysis System
**Python • YOLOv8 • OpenCV • PyTorch**

[![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-Demo-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube)](#)

**🔹 Built a 30 FPS computer vision pipeline** to detect players and ball, estimate pose, and predict release angle and velocity

**🔹 Improved stability** using multithreading, Kalman filtering, and trajectory smoothing
